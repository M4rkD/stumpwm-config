;;; Commentary:

;; This file uses xkeyboard extension
;; <https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/clx-xkeyboard> (i installed it
;; with quicklisp and compiled stumpwm with it).  A big part of the
;; following code came from the stumpwm example of that extension.

;; This file provides some functions and commands for working with
;; layouts.  I use it for:
;;
;; - different key bindings for different layouts,
;; - different layouts for different windows,
;; - setting internal input method in emacs if it is the current window
;;   (by sending a specified key sequence to it) instead of the global
;;   layout switching.

;;; Code:

(in-package :stumpwm)

;; We need it because stumpwm opens display before extension definition.
