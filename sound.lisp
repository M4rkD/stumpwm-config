;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a couple of commands to set sound parameters
;; (volume and muteness).  It looks mostly like a wrapper around
;; 'amixer' command, except that 'osd-sound' is called instead.
;;
;; This 'osd-sound' is a simple shell script that sends some Guile
;; expression to Guile-Daemon <https://github.com/alezost/guile-daemon>.
;; 2 things eventually happen: amixer is called and the sound value is
;; displayed in OSD.
;;
;; 'osd-sound' script can be found in my Guile-Daemon config:
;; <https://github.com/alezost/guile-daemon-config/blob/master/scripts/osd-sound>.

(defvar *al/sound-program* "osd-sound"
  "Name of a program to be called with amixer arguments.")

  "The number of the currently used simple control.")
